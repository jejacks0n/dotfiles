Dotfiles
========

These are your MacOS dotfiles.

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS https://jejacks0n.github.io/dotfiles)"
```

### Finalizing

You'll need to enter a few licenses, and go through system settings that can't easily be automated.

### Maintaining

To edit your dotfiles, run `dotconfig`, which will dump the Brewfile and open the chezmoi source directory for editing. You can then make changes and commit them as needed.

You'll be prompted to apply any updates.
